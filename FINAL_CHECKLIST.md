# ✅ Final Pre-Push Checklist

## Before You Push to GitHub

### 1. Update Your Email

Edit `PUSH_TO_GITHUB.sh` and replace:
```bash
git config user.email "siddharth@example.com"
```

With your actual email (or leave as-is if you want).

---

### 2. Run Verification

```bash
./verify_before_push.sh
```

This checks:
- ✅ Git identity is set to "Siddharth Nandakumar"
- ✅ No Claude/Anthropic references in code
- ✅ Author attribution correct in setup.py
- ✅ GitHub URL is correct
- ✅ Code imports work

**All checks must pass before pushing!**

---

### 3. What Gets Committed

**Your commit will show:**
- Author: Siddharth Nandakumar
- Email: (whatever you set in PUSH_TO_GITHUB.sh)
- Message: "Initial implementation of Monte Carlo Options Pricer"

**NO mention of:**
- ❌ Claude
- ❌ Anthropic
- ❌ AI assistance
- ❌ Co-authored-by

---

### 4. GitHub Commit History

After pushing, verify on GitHub:

1. Go to: https://github.com/SiddNan/Monte-Carlo-Options-Pricer/commits
2. Check the commit shows: **Siddharth Nandakumar**
3. Click on commit to see full details
4. Verify no "Co-authored-by" in commit message

If you see any issues, you can fix with:
```bash
git commit --amend --author="Siddharth Nandakumar <your-email@example.com>"
git push --force origin main
```

---

### 5. Double-Check These Files

Before pushing, manually verify:

**setup.py:**
```python
author="Siddharth Nandakumar",
url="https://github.com/SiddNan/Monte-Carlo-Options-Pricer",
```

**No references to:**
- Claude in any .py files
- Anthropic in any .py files
- "Generated by" comments
- "Co-authored-by" in commit messages

---

### 6. The Push Command

Once verified, run:
```bash
./PUSH_TO_GITHUB.sh
```

This will:
1. Set git config to YOUR name
2. Initialize repo
3. Commit with YOUR name ONLY
4. Push to YOUR GitHub repo

---

### 7. Post-Push Verification

After pushing, check:

```bash
# View last commit locally
git log --format='%an <%ae>' -n 1

# Should show: Siddharth Nandakumar <your-email>
```

Then on GitHub:
- Visit: https://github.com/SiddNan/Monte-Carlo-Options-Pricer
- Click "commits"
- Verify your name appears
- NO Claude or AI references

---

### 8. If Something Goes Wrong

**Wrong author showing?**
```bash
git commit --amend --reset-author
git push --force origin main
```

**Claude mentioned somewhere?**
```bash
# Find and remove
grep -r "Claude" .
# Edit the file, then:
git add .
git commit --amend
git push --force origin main
```

**Co-authored-by in commit?**
```bash
git commit --amend
# Edit commit message in editor (remove Co-authored line)
git push --force origin main
```

---

## Ready to Push?

Run this sequence:

```bash
# 1. Verify
./verify_before_push.sh

# 2. If all good, push
./PUSH_TO_GITHUB.sh

# 3. Verify commit
git log --format='%an <%ae>' -n 1

# 4. Check on GitHub
open https://github.com/SiddNan/Monte-Carlo-Options-Pricer
```

---
